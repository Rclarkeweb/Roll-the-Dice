# Roll the Dice

A small game that generates a different dice image for player one and player two and then compares to see if which player rolled the highest number or if it was a draw.  
Idea based on the 'Dicee game' from Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp, but I used JavaScript and jQuery.

## Features

- Used Font Awesome for icons.
- An information pop up box to display information to the user with a close button.
- JQuery was used for the DOM manipulation.

## Tech used

It was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery.
